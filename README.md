# K-Means and Variants: Experimental Evaluation

This project involves the implementation and experimental evaluation of the **k-means clustering algorithm** and at least two of its variants. The main goals are to analyze the **efficiency** and **quality** of clustering solutions using these algorithms.

## Objectives

1. **Implement Clustering Algorithms**:
   - Standard k-means (Lloyd's algorithm).
   - At least one additional variant (e.g., k-means++, k-medians, or k-medoids).

2. **Evaluate Clustering Quality**:
   - Internal quality measures (e.g., intra-cluster distance, silhouette score).
   - External quality measures (e.g., Rand Index) comparing results with ground truth.

3. **Optimize Cluster Count (k)**:
   - Implement methods like the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Experimental Analysis**:
   - Measure execution times.
   - Compare clustering quality across algorithms and datasets.
   - Test robustness with repeated executions and randomized initializations.

## Project Phases

### Part 1: Implementation of Clustering Algorithms
- Develop the standard k-means algorithm and at least one variant.
- Variants may differ in initialization methods, distance metrics, or stopping criteria.

### Part 2: Evaluation Methods
- **Internal Measures**: Quantify the quality of cluster separations based on intra- and inter-cluster distances.
- **External Measures**: Compare clustering results with ground truth using similarity metrics like Rand Index.
- Implement methods to determine the optimal number of clusters (e.g., Elbow Method).

### Part 3: Experimental Analysis
- Conduct experiments on provided datasets.
- Evaluate execution time, clustering quality, and the effectiveness of optimal k determination.
- Analyze algorithm performance with varying dataset properties.

## Deliverables
- **Code**:
  - Implemented algorithms, evaluation methods, and experiments.
  - Clear instructions for compilation and execution.
- **Report**:
  - Summary of implementations.
  - Experimental setup and results (with graphs and tables).
  - Conclusions on algorithm performance and clustering quality.

## Instructions
1. **Team Formation**: Teams of 4 members must be registered by February 26, 2024.
2. **Submission**:
   - A compressed `.zip` file containing:
     - All source code.
     - A PDF report (`InformeEquipoID.pdf`).
   - Submission deadline: March 22, 2024, at 23:59.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Quality of implementation, experiments, and documentation.
   - Demonstration of self-learning and methodology in the report.
